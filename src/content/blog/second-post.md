Analysis of LsaEnumerateLogonSessions

‚∏ª

üéØ Why This Function Matters

LsaEnumerateLogonSessions is an API in secur32.dll that lists all active logon sessions on a Windows system.
	‚Ä¢	Legitimate use: Windows itself and some diagnostic tools may query session info.
	‚Ä¢	Malware use: Attackers abuse this function to map out which users are logged in‚Äîa first step before stealing Kerberos tickets, credentials, or impersonating accounts.
	‚Ä¢	Think of it as the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs home right now?‚Äù API.

‚∏ª

ü¶† Malware Context

How attackers use it:
	1.	Call LsaEnumerateLogonSessions ‚Üí get session IDs (LUIDs).
	2.	Pair it with LsaGetLogonSessionData to pull usernames, domains, and ticket details.
	3.	Choose high-value sessions (Domain Admin, service accounts) to target for dumping or ticket injection.

Why it‚Äôs dangerous:
	‚Ä¢	Lets malware silently discover privileged accounts without touching the Domain Controller.
	‚Ä¢	Common in tools like Mimikatz and Rubeus.

üîç SOC Analyst‚Äôs Lens

What happens before the call
	‚Ä¢	Process loads secur32.dll.
	‚Ä¢	Often follows suspicious LSASS access (OpenProcess on lsass.exe).
	‚Ä¢	Privilege escalation may occur (SeDebugPrivilege enabled).

What happens after the call
	‚Ä¢	A list of session identifiers (LUIDs) is returned.
	‚Ä¢	Attacker then typically calls LsaGetLogonSessionData.
	‚Ä¢	Next actions may include ticket dumping, Pass-the-Ticket, or privilege escalation.

Benign vs Malicious

Indicator	Normal (Benign)	Suspicious (Malicious)
Caller	LSASS or legit diagnostic tools	Random unsigned binary
Follow-up	Nothing further	Immediately calling LsaGetLogonSessionData or touching LSASS memory
Frequency	Rare	Multiple rapid enumerations

üõ† Reverse Engineering Angle

In a PE file (static view):
	‚Ä¢	Look for imports from secur32.dll ‚Üí LsaEnumerateLogonSessions.
	‚Ä¢	Or runtime resolution: GetProcAddress("LsaEnumerateLogonSessions").

In assembly (x86 snippet):

push pLogonCount   ; receives number of sessions
push pLogonList    ; receives pointer to LUID array
call ds:LsaEnumerateLogonSessions

	‚Ä¢	Returned: pointer to an array of LUIDs (Locally Unique Identifiers) representing sessions.

Dynamic behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Follow-on API: LsaGetLogonSessionData almost always appears next.
	‚Ä¢	Sandbox trace: may show nothing outward (no network), since it‚Äôs purely local reconnaissance.

üïµÔ∏è Detection & Hunting

Windows Event IDs
	‚Ä¢	No direct event for the API itself.
	‚Ä¢	Look for indirect signs:
	‚Ä¢	4672 (privilege assigned) right before enumeration.
	‚Ä¢	4624/4634 (logons/logoffs) that don‚Äôt align with normal user activity.

Sysmon / EDR Signals
	‚Ä¢	Sysmon 10: suspicious process accessing lsass.exe.
	‚Ä¢	Sysmon 7: dynamic DLL loading (secur32.dll) by non-system process.

Hunt Tips
	‚Ä¢	Flag unsigned binaries resolving both LsaEnumerateLogonSessions and LsaGetLogonSessionData.
	‚Ä¢	Build detection on process ancestry: script host ‚Üí suspicious binary ‚Üí LSASS interaction.

‚∏ª

üìù Quick Recap
	‚Ä¢	What it does: Lists all active logon sessions (LUIDs).
	‚Ä¢	Why attackers care: Helps them spot valuable accounts to impersonate or dump.
	‚Ä¢	How to detect: Look for unusual processes calling this API, especially if followed by LsaGetLogonSessionData.
	‚Ä¢	SOC takeaway: If you see this outside of LSASS or trusted tools, it‚Äôs almost always bad news.
